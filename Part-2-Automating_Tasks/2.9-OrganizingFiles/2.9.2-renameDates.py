Say your boss emails you thousands of files with American-style dates
(MM-DD-YYYY) in their names and needs them renamed to European-
style dates (DD-MM-YYYY). This boring task could take all day to do by
hand! Let’s write a program to do it instead.
Here’s what the program does:
• It searches all the filenames in the current working directory for
American-style dates.
• When one is found, it renames the file with the month and day swapped
to make it European-style.
This means the code will need to do the following:
• Create a regex that can identify the text pattern of American-style dates.
• Call os.listdir() to find all the files in the working directory.
• Loop over each filename, using the regex to check whether it has a date.
• If it has a date, rename the file with shutil.move().
